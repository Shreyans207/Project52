               <li> Bears are extraordinarily intelligent animals. 
                    They have far superior navigation skills to humans; excellent memories; large brain to body ratio!! <br></li>
      
               <li> Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing. They can smell food, cubs, a mate or predators from miles away.
                    Their great eyesight allows them to detect when fruits are ripe. <br></li>
      
               <li> Bears care deeply about family members. 
                    They will risk their lives and even fight to the death in order to save a cub or sibling from danger. <br></li>

               <li> The bear is a common national personification for Russia (and the former USSR) and Germany.
                     The brown bear is Finland’s national animal. <br></li>

                    <li> Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals.
                         They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition <br></li>
           
                    <li> They can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph.
                         They are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities using a range of skills. <br></li>
           
                    <li> Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far low frequencies and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.
                         They are actually very clean animals. <br></li>
     
                    <li> Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. 
                         They and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years <br></li>

                         <li> There are around 3,000 cicada species, so they vary in size from 2.2 to 5.5 cm long.
                              Their wings are transparent and can seen with a light source. Each species of cicada has a different song.  <br></li>
                
                         <li> Cicadas can live a relatively long time : 4 to 17 years.
                              They spend most of their lives underground as larvae, followed by a short adulthood — from two to six weeks — above ground.<br></li>
                
                         <li> Tens of thousands to over a million insects can reside in a relatively small area of land. 
                              A group of periodicals that emerge at the same time is called a brood.  <br></li>
          
                         <li> Other Facts :- Cicadas are herbivores. Young cicadas eat liquid from plant roots. Adult cicadas do not feed.
                              Cicadas do not sting or bite. When they leave their burrow, sometimes cicadas will make chimneys of mud over the exit. <br></li>
